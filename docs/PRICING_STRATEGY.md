## Market Context & Anchoring

Our pricing is informed by real 2025 market data:

| Category | Example | Cost | Source |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Synthetic data platform | Rendered.ai org plan | $15k/month | [rendered.ai/pricing](https://rendered.ai/pricing/) |
| Training data vendor | Scale AI (2024 revenue) | $870M total | [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/google-scale-ais-largest-customer-plans-split-after-meta-deal-sources-say-2025-06-13/) |
| Training data vendor | Google → Scale (2025 plan) | ~$200M | [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/google-scale-ais-largest-customer-plans-split-after-meta-deal-sources-say-2025-06-13/) |
| Expert training labor | STEM specialists | >$125/hour | [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/handshake-ceo-ai-training-evolving-generalists-to-stem-experts-pay-2025-7) |

**Key insight:**
- $5,499 for a complete scene bundle is **well below** the $15k/month synthetic data platform subscriptions
- Yet **well above** commodity 3D asset marketplaces ($10-$100/model)
- Positioned as **production tooling**, not raw assets

## FAQ: Pricing Rationale

### Why $1.80 per episode?

**Benchmark 1: Synthetic platform costs**
- Rendered.ai: $15k/month for platform access
- We deliver finished product, not just tools

**Benchmark 2: Expert labor**
- STEM training experts: >$125/hour
- Manual episode creation would cost far more

**Benchmark 3: Validation overhead**
- Sim-verification catches failures
- Quality metrics provide confidence
- Saves debugging time downstream

### Why bundle discount only 15%?

- Encourages complete purchases without devaluing components
- Maintains margins for operational costs
- Industry-standard for SaaS bundling (10-20% typical)

### Why volume discounts up to 27%?

- Aligns with SaaS bulk pricing norms
- Reduces marginal cost at scale
- Competitive with annual platform subscriptions at 50-scene level

### What about competition?

**No direct competitors** offering identical product:
- Most synthetic data platforms: tools, not data
- Asset marketplaces: raw meshes, not sim-ready + episodes
- Training data vendors: human demonstrations, not sim

**Closest analogs:**
- Scale AI (human data, $870M revenue)
- Rendered.ai (platform, $15k/month)
- NVIDIA synthetic data (custom pricing, enterprise-only)
