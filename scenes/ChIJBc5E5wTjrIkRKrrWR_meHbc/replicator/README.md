# Replicator Bundle: ChIJBc5E5wTjrIkRKrrWR_meHbc

**Environment Type**: generic
**Scene Type**: generic

This bundle contains everything needed to run domain randomization and synthetic data generation for this scene in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Quick Start

1. Open `scene.usda` in Isaac Sim
2. Load the placement regions layer: `placement_regions.usda`
3. Open the Script Editor and run:

```python
from replicator_master import ReplicatorManager

manager = ReplicatorManager()
manager.list_policies()  # See available policies
manager.run_policy("dish_loading", num_frames=500)  # Run specific policy
```

## Available Policies

- **Precision Desk Manipulation** (`dexterous_pick_place`): Training for fine motor control picking small items from the desk and nightstand.
- **Room Tidying and Sorting** (`general_manipulation`): General purpose manipulation involving moving objects between the bed, desk, and nightstand.

## Placement Regions

- `desk_surface`: The primary workspace on the wooden desk. (horizontal)
- `nightstand_surface`: Top surface of the miniature nightstand. (horizontal)
- `bed_base_region`: The slatted area of the bed frame, representing a large flat but textured surface. (horizontal)

## Variation Assets

- **stationery**: writing_utensils
- **tableware**: drinking_vessel
- **electronics**: electronic_clutter

See `variation_assets/manifest.json` for full asset details and generation instructions.

```

## Adding Variation Assets

The `variation_assets/manifest.json` file lists all assets needed for domain randomization.
Assets can be:
- Generated using the BlueprintPipeline asset generation
- Downloaded from NVIDIA SimReady asset library
- Created manually in USD format

Place USDZ files in the `variation_assets/` directory with names matching the manifest.

## Customization

Edit `configs/<policy_id>.json` to customize:
- Number of objects to spawn
- Randomization parameters
- Capture resolution and annotations
- Which regions to use

## Generated by BlueprintPipeline

This bundle was auto-generated by the BlueprintPipeline replicator-job.
For issues or improvements, see the pipeline documentation.
