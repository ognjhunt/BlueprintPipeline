# SceneSmith Quality Config — Force SAM3D + Gemini Context Images
# =============================================================================
#
# Source this on the RunPod pod before running SceneSmith:
#   source configs/scenesmith_quality.env
#
# What this does:
#   1. Forces ALL assets through SAM3D (no ArtVIP reuse)
#   2. Enables Gemini context image generation for furniture agent
#   3. Uses Gemini for per-asset reference image generation
#   4. Disables articulated router (articulation detected post-generation)
#
# =============================================================================

# --- Force all assets through SAM3D (disables ArtVIP retrieval) ---
# This is the master switch: sets general_asset_source=generated,
# backend=sam3d, and disables articulated routing for ALL agent types.
SCENESMITH_PAPER_ALL_SAM3D=true

# --- Gemini context image for furniture agent ---
# Generates a room-level reference image via Gemini before placing furniture.
# The furniture agent uses this image to guide layout and asset selection.
SCENESMITH_PAPER_ENABLE_GEMINI_CONTEXT_IMAGE=true

# --- Gemini for per-asset image generation ---
# Each asset gets a Gemini-generated reference image before SAM3D creates
# the 3D mesh. This conditions SAM3D on a photorealistic reference.
SCENESMITH_PAPER_IMAGE_BACKEND=gemini

# --- Also enable furniture context image separately (belt and suspenders) ---
SCENESMITH_PAPER_ENABLE_FURNITURE_CONTEXT_IMAGE=true
